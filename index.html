<!-- 
1. Before you can make any part of your site work, you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that
interests you. Save it to a variable called topics.

2. We chose animals for our theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.

3. Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

4. Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

5. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place
them on the page.


6.When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should
stop playing.


7. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

8. This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

9. Add a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array. Then make a function
call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.

10. Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

Bonus Goals

Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.
Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud
to showcase in your portfolio

Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.

This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via
localStorage or cookies). -->
